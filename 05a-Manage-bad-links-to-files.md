If your project contains externally linked files, these files can be moved, renamed, or deleted. Linked files are shown with a red link icon.

The Mange bad links feature allows you to edit the existing link and replace it with a new one, by finding the correct file and itâ€™s location. Bad links do affect images, audio and video files. Text is not impacted unless you need to review an original text document. This is because the plain text, on which coding occurs, is imported into the QualCoder database.

If you are importing an REFI-QDA project with external links, you will likely need to update the links to files using this function.
