#  Coding images

Images can be coded in a similar way to text coding. Select a code. Left-click and drag to highlight the area you want to assign to the code. Right-click will open a menu where you can remove the coding or add a memo. At the bottom of the screen there is a slider control to re-size the image. Coded rectangles are coloured to match the code colour. 

The top right of the dialog shows some details of a clicked on coded area - by showing the code name pixel positions and percentage area of the entire image. Hovering the mouse over this space will show any memo for the coded area.

* Shortcut H. Press h when on the image to hide and undie the top controls section of the screen.

#  Categories and codes

Categories are used to organise codes. Categories are organised hierarchically in a tree structure. You can move codes into categories and move categories into larger categories. You can move categories and codes out of their current position. Codes and categories can be merged by dropping a code onto a code or a category onto a category. Categories and codes can be assigned memos. Right-click on a category or code to rename. Right click on a code to change the color.

To reduce the number of codes shown in the code tree. In the coding windows (code text, code, a/v or code image), right-click on the code tree and select Show codes like from the menu. Then enter text in the text box. This will then only show codes that contain that text. Enter nothing into the text box and press OK to show all codes again.

In the codes tree on the left, right clicking on a code opens a context menu for various options.
One option is Show coded files - this shows everywhere you have coded with the selected code. Clicking on a particular coded section will open that code in the original context for further insight.
