#  Coding images

Images can be coded in a similar way to text coding. Select a code. Left-click and drag to highlight the area you want to assign to the code. Right-click will open a menu where you can remove the coding or add a memo. At the bottom of the screen there is a slider control to re-size the image. Coded rectangles are coloured to match the code colour. Right-click on the image for rotation options.

The top right of the dialog shows some details of a clicked on coded area - by showing the code name pixel positions and percentage area of the entire image. Hovering the mouse over this space will show any memo for the coded area.

## Important coded areas
Important coded areas, such as exemplars for a report, can be flagged Important by using the right-click menu when on the coded areas and selecting Important. At the top of the screen is a button with a star symbol. This button toggles between showing all coded areas and the coded areas flagged as Important.

## Shortcuts

* Shortcut H. Press h when on the image to hide and unhide the top controls section of the screen.

* Press + or - buttons to enlarge or shrink the image.

## Export

The image with coded areas can be exported to an html file. After opening the file in a browser, mouse hover over coded areas shows the code name and memos.

#  Categories and codes

Categories are used to organise codes. Categories are organised hierarchically in a tree structure. You can move codes into categories and move categories into larger categories. You can move categories and codes out of their current position. Codes and categories can be merged by dropping a code onto a code or a category onto a category. Categories and codes can be assigned memos. Right-click on a category or code to rename. Right click on a code to change the color.

To reduce the number of codes shown in the code tree. In the coding windows (code text, code, a/v or code image), right-click on the code tree and select Show codes like from the menu. Then enter text in the text box. This will then only show codes that contain that text. Enter nothing into the text box and press OK to show all codes again.

In the codes tree on the left, right clicking on a code opens a context menu for various options.
One option is Show coded files - this shows everywhere you have coded with the selected code. Clicking on a particular coded section will open that code in the original context for further insight.

## Accessibility and code colours

In the Coding menu there is an option called **Colour scheme**.

You can apply a range of colours to a range of selected codes, rather than rely in the random generated colours or a one at a time change of colours for each code. In this area you can also view how the code colours may appear to someone who has a variety of colour blindness: red-weak, red blind, green-weak or green blind.
