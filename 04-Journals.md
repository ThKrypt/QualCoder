# Journals
You can record your thoughts when coding your data in journals. Make use of these to develop ideas and themes. 
Journals can be exported as a single journal or all journal text can be collated and exported as a single file.
Journals can be deleted.

There is a search option to search through journal text. The search uses regex symbols for more flexibility.
* A dot '.' is used as a wild card, e.g. '.ears' will match ‘bears’ and 'years'
* A '?' after a character will match one or none times that character, e.g. 'bears?' will match 'bear' and 'bears'
* A '*' after a character will match zero or more times. 
* '\.' will match the dot symbol, '\?' will match the question mark. '\n' will match the line ending symbol.
