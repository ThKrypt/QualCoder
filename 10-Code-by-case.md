## There is reduced functionality in the code by case section. 

Text cannot be auto-coded. Instead open the file in the Code text option. The reason is that auto-coding text may code beyond the text assigned to the case.

In audio/video, code segments can be applied to time sections of the audio or video. However, any associated text transcript is not displayed. Displaying bot the video file and the text transcript was difficult in the code by case approach. However, you can open the file in Code audio/video to code the text and the audio/video segments at the same time.
