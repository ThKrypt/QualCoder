# Graph

A graph of categories and codes is displayed. There are options to limited the codes and categories shown – such as All or Selected categories. Click on the image area and + or – will zoom in and out.

Each code or category can be moved around by clicking near the edge of the box and dragging it around. Clicking on the text allows you to temporarily change the code or category wording. Right-clicking in a code gives a menu of options such as displaying the memo, or displaying all the case or file text that has been coded with the selected code.

Right-clicking on a line allows you to change the thickness, change to dotted line style or change the line colour. This might be useful for emphasis. Right-clicking on empty space allows you to add free text boxes, files text boxes, and case text boxes., and also to insert extra lines between components.

Coded text, coded images and coded A/V segments can be shown. Memos of coded text, coded image and coded A/V segments can be shown in text boxes. Each of these has tooltips to give more information. You cannot display the same coded segment multiple times in the graph.

Graphs can be saved, loaded and deleted. Graphs can be exported as png files.
