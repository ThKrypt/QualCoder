#  Categories and codes

Categories are used to organise codes. Categories are organised hierarchically in a tree structure. You can move codes into categories and move categories into larger categories. You can move categories and codes out of their current position. Codes and categories can be merged by dropping a code onto a code or a category onto a category. Categories and codes can be assigned memos. Right-click on a category or code to rename. Right click on a code to change the color.

To reduce the number of codes shown in the code tree. In the coding windows (code text, code, a/v or code image), right-click on the code tree and select Show codes like from the menu. Then enter text in the text box. This will then only show codes that contain that text. Enter nothing into the text box and press OK to show all codes again.

In the codes tree on the left, right clicking on a code opens a context menu for various options.
One option is Show coded files - this shows everywhere you have coded with the selected code. Clicking on a particular coded section will open that code in the original context for further insight.
