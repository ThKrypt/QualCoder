#  REFI-QDA
The Rotterdam Exchange Format Initiative (REFI) is an open standard for exporting and importing codebooks and projects from and to different computer-aided qualitative data analysis software. The website for the exchange initiative is www.qdasoftware.org

Currently, QualCoder is able to export and import a codebook. Exportation of a project and importation of a project are experimental and do not meet the full REFI-QDA standard. For example: greater than 2GB files are not stored externally. Importation of project.qpdx files partly works, but at least for Nvivo, coding stripes do not correctly match text selections. External files greater than 2GB may not be imported into QualCoder project. Features such as sets and graphs cannot be imported. Other data formats are not preserved, for example date or boolean would be converted to text data.

# RQDA
Projects made with RQDA (http://rqda.r-forge.r-project.org/) can be directly imported. All data except for file categories are imported.

Close any opened project. Then in the Main Menu under Project click on RQDA Project import. You will be asked to create a new project- so enter a name. Then you will be asked to select the RQDA project file. QualCoder will then import the data.
