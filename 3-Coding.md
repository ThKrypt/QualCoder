#  Categories and codes

Categories are used to organise codes. Categories are organised hierarchically in a tree structure.

You can move codes into categories and move categories into larger categories. You can move categories and codes out of their current position. Codes and categories can be merged by dropping a code onto a code or a category onto a category.

# Coding Text

Select Code text from the Coding menu. This is the central dialog for assigning codes to text. Once text segments are coded, hovering the mouse over the coding shows the code name as a tooltip. Clicking on the coded segment also shows the code name. Press the View File button to select a file to open for coding. Create a new code by right-clicking in the left hand window. Codes can also be assigned a colour by right-clicking on the code and selecting the change code colour option. Other options from the right-click menu include adding a memo to the code, deleting the code, renaming, adding a new code, and adding a new category.

Select a code, then select some text. Right-click and mark the text to assign it to the selected code. Hover the mouse pointer over coded text to see a tooltip of the code. Coded text can be uncoded by clicking on the text segment and pressing the Unmark button.

Add an annotation (like a memo for a text segment) to a text selection. The text will become **bold** to mark the position of the annotation.

You can also automatically code text segments using the Auto Code button. Enter the text you want to autocode. A dialog asks for one or more files to autocode. All matching text will be assigned the selected code.



##  Coding images

Images can be coded in a similar way to text coding. Select a code. Left-click and drag to highlight the area you want to assign to the code. Right-click will open a menu where you can remove the coding or add a memo. At the bottom of the screen there is a slider control to re-size the image.

## Coding audio and video

When coding audio or video, two windows are displayed, shown below. One window has the audio or video playing. The other window has the controls and a button to begin and end a coded segment. The controls window shows the codes in the bottom left pane and the .transcribed file text is shown in the bottom right pane. The transcription text can also be coded and annotated in this window. Right-clicking on a timestamp will give you a menu option to go to that section of the video. If a video has multiple audio tracks, you can cane the audio track too. Checking the scroll checkbox allows the transcript to scroll in time with the video, based on detected timestamps, however, you need to uncheck the scroll to be able to code the transcript.

Once a segment is made using the _Start segment/Stop segment_ button this can be assigned to a code by right clicking on the relevant code and assigning the segment.

Coding stripes for the coded segments are shown in the upper pane. Hovering the mouse over each stripe shows the code name, time segment and any memo attached to that coded segment. Right clicking on a coded segment stripe shows a menu that can be used to edit he memo or delete the coded segment. Coded stripes are shown on various lines so that they do not overlap. 

The transcript text can also be coded and annotated in this dialog. However, when the Scroll transcript check box is checked, this cannot be performed. Playing the video when this is check will scroll the transcript using the timestamps in time with the video.

##  Codebook

A codebook is a list of your codes. Each code memo should detail the reasons for the purpose of each code. The codebook can be exported to a text file. The codebook also shows the frequency of the codes used (from all coders). Example codebook output is shown below. As codes and categories are put in a tree like structure the double minus ‘–‘ indicates the subordinate codes and categories within a category.

##  Node graph

A graph of categories and codes is displayed. There are several options to change what is shown – such as Black and White, All or selected categories.

Each code or category can be moved around by clicking near the edge of the box and dragging it around. Clicking on the text allows you to temporarily change the code or category wording. Right-clicking in a code gives a menu of options such as displaying the memo, or displaying all the case or file text that has been coded with the selected code.
