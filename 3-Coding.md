#  Categories and codes

Categories are used to organise codes. Categories are organised hierarchically in a tree structure. You can move codes into categories and move categories into larger categories. You can move categories and codes out of their current position. Codes and categories can be merged by dropping a code onto a code or a category onto a category. Categories and codes can be assigned memos. Right-click on a category or code to rename. Right click on a code to change the color.

# Coding Text

text segments are coded, hovering the mouse over the coding shows the code name as a tooltip. Clicking on the coded segment also shows the code name. Press the View File button to select a file to open for coding. Create a new code by right-clicking in the left hand window. 

Codes can  be assigned a colour by right-clicking on the code and selecting the change code colour option. Other options from the right-click menu include adding a memo to the code, deleting the code, renaming, adding a new code, and adding a new category.

The easiest way to code text, is to select some text, then left-click with the mouse on a code.

A second way is to select a code, then select some text. Right-click and mark the text to assign it to the selected code. Hover the mouse pointer over coded text to see a tooltip of the code. Coded text can be uncoded by clicking on the text segment and pressing the Unmark button.

Overlapping codes can be difficult to view clearly. Overlaps have an overline above the text to show overlapping sections. Mouse hover will show coded text, including overlaps. Clicking in an overlap shows a selection box at the top of the screen where you can select to view one or the other highlighted coded text.

Add an annotation (like a memo for a text segment) to a text selection. The text will become **bold** to mark the position of the annotation.

You can also automatically code text segments using the Auto Code button. Enter the text you want to autocode. A dialog asks for one or more files to autocode. All matching text will be assigned the selected code. Multiple sections of text can be assigned by autocode using the pipe ‘|’ symbol. For example, politics|politicians can be assigned to the same code at the same time.

## Convenience methods for loading text files

Some projects may have many text files and the view file dialog may present too many files to open. Right-click on the View File button to select options such as: 
the next file alphabetically, 
select the file which was most recently coded, 
or go to a bookmarked location in a file. To create a bookmark, right click in some text when coding and select the bookmark option. The bookmark works for only one project at a time, so if you opened a different project, the bookmark would be incorrect or might not work at all.

## Modifying code positions

When in the text area, click on a code with the mouse (Note the code must not be overlapping with another code at that position). Press the following key combinations to extend or shrink the coded text segment.

* Shift + left arrow            Extends coded text to the left
* Shift + right arrow          Extends coded text to the right
* Alt + left arrow               Shrinks coded text from the right hand side towards the left
* Alt + right arrow            Shrinks coded text from the left hand side towards the right

You can also right-click on a code and select change start position or change end position by  a number of characters.


#  Coding images

Images can be coded in a similar way to text coding. Select a code. Left-click and drag to highlight the area you want to assign to the code. Right-click will open a menu where you can remove the coding or add a memo. At the bottom of the screen there is a slider control to re-size the image. Coded rectangles are coloured to match the code colour.

# Coding audio and video

When coding audio or video, two windows are displayed, shown below. One window has the audio or video playing. The other window has the controls and a button to begin and end a coded segment. The controls window shows the codes in the bottom left pane and the .transcribed file text is shown in the bottom right pane. The transcription text can also be coded and annotated in this window. Right-clicking on a timestamp will give you a menu option to go to that section of the video. If a video has multiple audio tracks, you can cane the audio track too. Checking the scroll checkbox allows the transcript to scroll in time with the video, based on detected timestamps, however, you need to uncheck the scroll to be able to code the transcript.

## Keyboard shortcuts

* Ctrl R and Alt R are shortcuts to rewind 5 or 30 seconds
* Ctrl F will forward 30 seconds
* Ctrl S and Ctrl P will stop/start (play/pause)
* Ctrl Shift < will slow play rate down to a minimum of 0.1
* Ctrl Shift > will increase play rate up to two times.

## Audio Video segments

Once a segment is made using the _Start segment/Stop segment_ button this can be assigned to a code by right clicking on the relevant code and assigning the segment.

Coding stripes for the coded segments are shown in the upper pane. Hovering the mouse over each stripe shows the code name, time segment and any memo attached to that coded segment. Right clicking on a coded segment stripe shows a menu that can be used to edit he memo or delete the coded segment. Coded stripes are shown on various lines so that they do not overlap. 

The transcript text can also be coded and annotated in this dialog. However, when the Scroll transcript check box is checked, this cannot be performed. Playing the video when this is check will scroll the transcript using the timestamps in time with the video.

**Linking text to coded segments**

There are two ways to link text and coded segments. One way is to select text (it can be coded or preferably uncoded) then assign it to a segment. First select the text and right-click Prepare text link to segment. Then right-click on the receiving segment, choose Link text to segment, to assign the text.

A second way is to select a segment and link it to a text selection via a similar process.


## Modifying code positions in the text area

When in the text area, click on a code with the mouse (Note the code must not be overlapping with another code at that position). Press the following key combinations to extend or shrink the coded text segment.
* Shift + left arrow            Extends coded text to the left
* Shift + right arrow          Extends coded text to the right
* Alt + left arrow               Shrinks coded text from the right hand side towards the left
* Alt + right arrow            Shrinks coded text from the left hand side towards the right
You can also right-click on a code and select change start position or change end position by  a number of characters.

## The video window

On the video window you can right-click and have options to change the window size, in pixels. You can also export a screenshot. The screenshot will be save as Frame_yyyymmdd_hh_mm_ss.jpg in the directory listed in the Settings.
