## What is QualCoder?
QualCoder is free, open source software for qualitative data analysis. 
With QualCoder you can code text and images, write journal notes and memos. You can categorise codes into a tree-like hierarchical categorisation scheme. Coding for audio and video is under development and requires the VLC media player.
Reports can be generated for text coding and for coder comparison using the Cohenâ€™s Kappa statistic. A graph displaying codes and categories can be generated to visualise the coding hierarchy. Most reports can be exported at html, open document text (ODT) or as plain text files.
QualCoder is written in python 3 using Qt for the graphical interface. A Sqlite database is used to store the coding data.
There is also a wordpress site for QualCoder at https://qualcoder.wordpress.com/.

###  Why use QualCoder?
Firstly, QualCoder is free. You do not need to pay for a commercial software license. QualCoder is easy to use and contains the core functionalities required for qualitative analysis. You use Linux. QualCoder has been developed on Linux and also works on Windows and MacOS. There are many Free/Libre Open Source Software (FLOSS) supporters who are willing to use and support FLOSS development.

## Downloading files and dependencies
Download the latest QualCoder from GitHub: https://github.com/ccbogel/QualCoder. Unzip the folder. The main program code is in the QualCoder folder. The Examples folder contains some example files which can be loaded into a test QualCoder project. There are an install.sh and a QualCoder.desktop file which are used to create a Linux Launcher.

**Microsoft Windows**

You will need to download and install Python 3. Then install PyQt5, lxml and Pillow modules. A Python 3 release can be obtained here: https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/. Finally, you need to have the VLC media player installed. You can get this from the Windows Store or from their website: https://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-windows.html 
Once a Python 3 release is installed you should be able to install the modules PyQT5, lxml and Pillow using the following commands in the Windows Command prompt (The prompt is under Windows System):

python -m pip install pyqt5

python -m pip install lxml 

python -m pip install Pillow

**Linux**

I have created a QualCoder.deb package for easy install on Debian/Ubuntu systems. (It may not always install well depending on your system). You can try a re-install too.

If you want to install using the install.sh script, follow these instructions to create a program launcher:
Go to your downloads folder. The example script below assumes you have downloaded the QualCoder-master.zip. Unzip QualCoder-master.zip. Open the uzipped folder and make the _install.sh_ script executable.  Open a terminal and type the following to install QualCoder:

cd Downloads/QualCoder-master

Run the _install.sh_ file. The install process will ask for your permission to install QualCoder into the /usr/share directory. It will also download the additional dependencies.

./install.sh


**MacOS**

Install Python3 and VLC. Install the Python dependencies using pip:

pip install pyqt5 lxml pillow six

There is no desktop icon launch right now for QualCoder. Open a new Terminal window in the directory and launch with python qualcoder.py.

# Starting QualCoder

### Linux
If you have successfully installed the debian package or sucessfully run the install.sh script there will be a program launcher. Double-click to start.

Alternatively, using the terminal, move to the inner QualCoder folder and open the qualcoder.py file:

python3 qualcoder.py

### Windows
In Windows create a shortcut to the qualcoder.py file and double click to open. Alternatively, using the command prompt, move to the directory and open the qualcoder.py file:

python3 qualcoder.py

### Mac OS
There is no desktop icon launch right now for QualCoder. Open a new Terminal window in the directory and launch with python qualcoder.py.

## Backups

QualCoder does make a backup of a project when the project is first opened. I recommend that you make a backup before doing any substantial changes, such as reorganising codes and categories.
